# Planetside Battle Simulator 3D

Planetside Battle Simulator is a program built in Unity that aims to simulate the battle flow of Planetside battles. The goal is to be able to learn how the flow of battle changes based on different base designs and use that information to determine what makes a well-designed base that can handle large populations.
